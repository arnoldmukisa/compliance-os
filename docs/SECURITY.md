# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Compliance OS project.

## Data Security

### Configuration Storage
- Sensitive configuration data is stored in Supabase using JSONB
- Encryption at rest is handled by Supabase
- Access is restricted by organization ID
- No sensitive data is logged or exposed in client-side code

### Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase handles authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Organization-level data isolation
- Secure session management

### API Security
- All API requests require authentication
- Rate limiting implemented
- Input validation on all endpoints
- HTTPS required for all communications

## Integration Security

### Credentials Management
- Integration credentials stored securely in Supabase
- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access tokens rotated regularly
- No credentials exposed in logs or client-side

### Service Connections
- Secure webhook implementations
- OAuth 2.0 for supported services
- Regular connection health checks
- Automatic disconnection on security issues

## Best Practices

1. Regular security audits
2. Dependency vulnerability scanning
3. Secure coding guidelines
4. Regular penetration testing
5. Security incident response plan
